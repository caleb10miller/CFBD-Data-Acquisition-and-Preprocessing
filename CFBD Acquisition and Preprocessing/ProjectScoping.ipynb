I aim to be a bridge between these departments. I have worked with a lot of data relating to sports, as my hope is to enter the world of sports analytics/science. My skills include:\n","\n","* Coding Languages: Python, R, C++, SQL, VBA\n","* Data Analysis and Visualization: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Tableau, PowerBI\n","* Statistical Analysis: Hypothesis Testing, Regression Analysis\n","* Machine Learning: Model Development and Evaluation, Scikit-Learn\n","* Web Scraping\n","* Monte Carlo Simulation\n","\n","Moving forward, I would like to grow by adding the TensorFlow package to my arsenal of skills. Additionally, I would like to improve my networking and presentation skills. Different domains I am interested in studying includes the stock market and the medical field. Entering the world of stocks would allow me to incorperate my undergraudate minor of Economics with my career.

Namely, we can look into the excitement index and attendance over different levels of divisions and conferences (Fbs vs Fcs vs D2 - divisions) (SEC vs Big 10 vs other - conferences). Furthermore, we can analyze these variables by win totals and kickoff time. This data will give greater insight into scheduling and allow the administration to maximize the excitement and attendance for their respective schools
