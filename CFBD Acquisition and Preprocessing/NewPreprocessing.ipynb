Additionally, I would like to improve my networking and presentation skills. Different domains I am interested in studying includes the stock market and the medical field.

Namely, we can look into the excitement index and attendance over different levels of divisions and conferences (Fbs vs Fcs vs D2 - divisions) (SEC vs Big 10 vs other - conferences). Furthermore, we can analyze these variables by win totals and kickoff time. This data will give greater insight into scheduling and allow the administration to maximize the excitement and attendance for their respective schools

Additionally, having data for gameday revenue would be helpful to quantify how much variables such as excitement and attendance affect money generated. Another limitation of the data is that we are missing variables for some rows of data. For example, the attendance variable is blank for many data entries.
